# powershell-helpers

Hello there.

This is my collection of powershell scripts that I use now and which are not specific to any particular environment or company I'm working in!
Unfortunately most of the scripts I work on are in private repos, but I'm trying to remove anything sensitive and deposit them here.

Check the readme under each directory for more script instructions.

- **azure\export_network_ip_info.ps1**
 _AzureRM Script to run through all the used IPs in a region then output info on them_

    
- **azure\azure-image-region-copy.ps1**
_This script is designed to copy azure managed images from one region to another._


- **check_expiring_users.ps1**
_Do users on your domain refuse to change their password before it expires? Are you sick of them bothering you to reset it? This script sends a robot over to their house to mess up their living room and break plates everytime someone ignores the "your password will expire soon" prompt.
It also emails them every day 2 weeks before it expires to let them know._
