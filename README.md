# powershell-helpers

Hello There!

This is my collection of powershell scripts that I use now and which are not specific to any particular environment or company I'm working in!
Unfortunately most of the scripts I work on are in private repos, but I'm trying to remove anything sensitive and deposit them here.

Check the readme under each directory for more script instructions.
