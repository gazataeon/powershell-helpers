- **check_expiring_users.ps1**
_Do users on your domain refuse to change their password before it expires? Are you sick of them bothering you to reset it? This script sends a robot over to their house to mess up their living room and break plates everytime someone ignores the "your password will expire soon" prompt.
It also emails them every day 2 weeks before it expires to let them know._
